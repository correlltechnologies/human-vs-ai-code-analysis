# human-vs-ai-code-analysis
This repository contains an empirical analysis of stylistic and structural differences between human-written code and AI-generated code, based on the OSS-forge/HumanVsAICode dataset.  The project is designed to be fully runnable in Google Colab and produce publishable results (plots, tables, insights).
